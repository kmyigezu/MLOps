# MLOps Class Repository

This repository contains all materials, code, and documentation for my MLOps course work. It's organized to facilitate the development and deployment of machine learning projects following MLOps best practices.

## Repository Structure

```

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a conda environment: `conda create --name mlops python=3.12`
3. Activate the conda environment:
   - `conda activate mlops`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Course Progress
